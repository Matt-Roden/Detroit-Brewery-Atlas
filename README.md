### Abstract:

The Detroit Brewery Atlas is a quick and easy way to find and favorite breweries within the city of Detroit, Michigan. This application is meant for first time travelers to Detroit, who are also big time beer lovers. The application allows for a user to quickly skim through a list of all the city's breweries, find quick and easy information including the name, phone number, website, and address. The app also allows the user to favorite breweries they are interested in. Favorited breweries can be viewed on the _Favorites_ page and will persist for the user even after leaving the site. So, the next time a user visits the site, all of their favorites will still be there!

This application consumes the [Open Breweries Data Base API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) to grab the data for this website. The objective was to find a neche audience to appeal to, which is why the app is specifically targeted to users traveling to a specific city and is themed around the city of Detroit, MI. 

Detroit and it's citizens have their own unique perspective. This application's design was inpsired by color palettes commonly found around the city, which many people describe as 'gritty'. I chose to incorporate images and colors that reflect this esthetic in order to subtly inject some of the essence of the city and it's culture into the application. 

This application was designed with responsiveness and user empathy in mind. It was designed with efficiency and ease-of-use for users of all different levels of technology proficiencies and confidence, to quickly find and use the information on the app. It is completely Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile Responsive, and was built using a Mobile-First approach.

This project was built as a Mod 3 student project for The Turing School of Software & Design. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)
