### Abstract:

The Detroit Brewery Atlas is a quick and easy way to find and favorite breweries within the city of Detroit, Michigan. This application is meant for first time travelers to Detroit, who are also big time beer lovers. The application allows for a user to quickly skim through a list of all the city's breweries, find quick and easy information including the name, phone number, website, and address, as well as allow the user to favorite breweries. Favorited breweries can be viewed on the _Favorites_ page and will persist for the user even after leaving the site. So, the next time a user visits the site, all of their favorites will still be there!

The Detroit Brewery Atlas consumes the [Open Breweries Data Base API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) to grab the data for this website. The objective was to find a neche audience to appeal to, which is why the app is specifically targeted as users traveling to Detroit and is themed around the city of Detroit, MI. 

Detroit and it's citizens have their own unique perspective. This application's design was inpsired by color palettes commonly found around the city, which many people describe as 'gritty'. I chose to incorporate images and colors that reflect this esthetic in order to inject some of the essence of the city and it's culture into the application. 

This application was designed with responsiveness and user empathy in mind. It is quick and easy for users off all technology proficiencies and confidence to find and use the information. It is completely Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile Responsive, and was built in a Mobile-First approach.

This project was built as a student project for The Turing School of Software & Design. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)
